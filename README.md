# DotNetWebsite

A movie database made using asp.net core by Marijn Kneppers and Edison Hu

## Know issues
- Movie posters don't load on the school network because the website is marked as "Illegal or unethical" (because all usefull websites are)
- There are 2 connection strings. One for home and one for school. Make sure you are using the right one in Program.cs. If you are using a personal computer at school you are totally out of luck.

## Things to note
A lot of pages related to Identity are not present in this project. These are automatically generated by asp.net core identity. The files that are present are explicit overrides.
